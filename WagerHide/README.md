# Dota2-WagerHide

A modification for Dota 2 to hide wager options at start of the match.

### How to install

1. Create a new `folder` in your `steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game` directory.
2. Move the `wagerhide.vpk` file to your folder
3. Edit the `steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/gameinfo.gi` file. In the `FileSystem/SearchPaths` structure add a new row before the `Game dota` line: `Game folder`, where `folder` is the name of your previously created folder in step 1

Note: You have to repeat step 3 after each major update.
